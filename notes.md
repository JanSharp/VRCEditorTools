# Ideas

- [ ] tool where you create a box and then select all objects within that area
- [ ] menu item to change selection to select parent where all children are selected and deselect said children
- [ ] menu item to deselect children of prefabs
- [ ] selection stage does not refresh with renames
- [ ] keep original name in bulk replace
- [ ] toggle shown is sloooooow
- [ ] everything that I'm doing that iterates all objects does not work inside of prefab preview scenes or whatever they're called
- [ ] add support in selection stage for non game object objects
